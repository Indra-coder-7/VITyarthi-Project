# Project Statement  
## Smart Classroom Energy Saver (SCES)

---

## 1. Introduction

Energy wastage is a common issue in classrooms where electrical appliances such as lights and fans remain on even when the room is unoccupied. This leads to unnecessary electricity consumption and increased operational costs. To address this issue, the Smart Classroom Energy Saver (SCES) system is designed as a simple, automated simulation that demonstrates how technology can be used to reduce energy waste effectively.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Traditional classrooms rely on manual switching of lights and electrical equipment. When students or instructors forget to turn off these devices, significant amounts of energy are wasted.  
There is a need for an automated solution that:

- Detects classroom occupancy  
- Controls lighting based on room status  
- Reduces human error in energy management  

---

## 3. Purpose of the Project

The purpose of this project is to design and simulate an automated system that intelligently manages classroom lighting based on presence detection. The system ensures that lights turn **ON** when the room is occupied and **OFF** when empty, promoting energy efficiency.

---

## 4. Project Scope

The simulation includes:

- A virtual motion sensor that detects occupancy  
- A controller that processes sensor input  
- A light system that toggles ON/OFF  
- A console-based output for demonstration  

_Not included in this project: real hardware sensors, databases, or CRUD operations._

## 5. Methodology

1. **Problem Identification** – Recognizing energy waste in educational spaces.  
2. **Solution Design** – Planning an automated occupancy-based switching system.  
3. **Implementation** – Developing a Python simulation to replicate sensor behavior.  
4. **Testing & Evaluation** – Running multiple cycles to observe light automation.

## 6. Expected Outcomes

- Reduced unnecessary energy usage  
- Increased awareness of automation possibilities in classrooms  
- A functional demonstration of intelligent energy-saving technology  

---

## 7. Conclusion

The Smart Classroom Energy Saver (SCES) project provides a simple yet effective simulation of how automation can be used to reduce energy consumption in real-world environments. Although basic, it highlights the potential of incorporating smart systems into educational institutions to promote sustainability.
